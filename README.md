## Features

Below are training modules that are available in the BlueScript webapp:

1. **Quick Visual Perception module**.

   - Training to identify and type characters that appear on the screen in 250ms or less.
   - It improves perceptual speed, visual memory, visualization, and temporal visual processing.

2. **Sequential Visual Memory module** (Sequential Visual Perception)

   - This module trains you to identify and memorize a series of characters in sequence, and then retype them after a period of time.
   - It improves visual sequential memory, working memory, perceptual speed, visual motor accuracy, and sequential processing ability.

3. **Character Guesstimate module**.

   - This is a training program that shows a part of a character and asks you to identify a character that is not fully shown as quickly as possible.
   - It improves form, perception, topographic perception, information processing speed and simultaneous processing ability.

4. **Character Match module**.

   - This module trains you to click on a matching string from a set of strings that are visually similar to the prompt.
   - It improves visual planning, perceptual speed, shape recognition, visual memory, eye movements, directional and temporal visual processing.

5. **Character Sequencing module**.
   - Trains students to find prompts in sequence and type characters using the right arrow key and spacebar.
   - Improves temporal visual processing, visual attention, visual discrimination, visual picture rationale, and visual speed.
