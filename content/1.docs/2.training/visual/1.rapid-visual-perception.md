title: Rapid Visual Perception
description: Training to quickly recognize and input letters displayed briefly on the screen
---

## Overview

Rapid Visual Perception training enhances the ability to identify and reproduce visual stimuli presented typically in less than 0.25 seconds. This training helps improve the speed of visual information processing, expands visual range, and enhances perception speed, visual memory, visualization, and temporal visual processing.

Each training attempt follows this sequence and repeats until the allotted training time is exceeded:

1. Letters are displayed briefly on the screen.

2. After the letters disappear, the trainee inputs the letters they remember and checks their answers.

## Training Settings

### Duration (Minutes)

The training ends after the current attempt finishes if the preset training duration is exceeded. The recommended training duration is around 5 minutes, and sessions exceeding 10 minutes are not advised.

### Character Type

Sets the type of characters used in the training. Using characters from the trainee's native language is most effective. The available character types are:

- **Numbers**: Digits from 0 to 9
- **Alphabets**: Uppercase letters from A to Z
- **Alphabets + Numbers**: Uppercase letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9)
- **Korean**: Korean consonants (e.g., ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ) and vowels (e.g., ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ)

**To lower the difficulty**, select simpler character types (e.g., from `Alphabets + Numbers` to `Alphabets` or `Numbers`).

**To increase the difficulty**, select more complex character types (e.g., from `Numbers` to `Alphabets + Numbers`).

### Character Length

Sets the length of the character string used in the training. The length can be set from `1` to `10`. Longer character lengths significantly **increase difficulty**.

### Display Time (Seconds)

Sets the duration for which characters are displayed on the screen. The display time can be adjusted from `0.05` to `1` second. Shorter display times **slightly** increase the difficulty. The recommended range is `0.05` to `0.5` seconds. If further difficulty adjustment is needed, modify the character length instead.

## Adjusting Training Difficulty

Based on training results, you can determine whether the current settings are appropriate:

### Accuracy/Average Accuracy

- **Below 70%**: The difficulty is too high. If low accuracy persists (2–3 sessions), reduce the difficulty for the next session.
- **70%–80%**: The difficulty is appropriate. Continue with the current settings for the next session.
- **Above 80%**: The difficulty is too low. Increase the difficulty for the next session.

After assessing the difficulty using the above criteria, adjust the training settings within the recommended ranges.
