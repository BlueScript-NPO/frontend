title: Character Sequencing
description: Training to locate and input characters in sequence
---

## Overview

Character Sequencing training involves locating and inputting characters displayed on the screen in a specific order using the right arrow key and spacebar. This training improves temporal visual processing, visual attention, visual discrimination, spatial reasoning, and visual speed.

Each training attempt follows this sequence and repeats until the allotted training time is exceeded:

1. At the start of an attempt, a sequence of characters is displayed at the top, and an input field is shown below.

2. Use the right arrow key to move the cursor in the input field. When the cursor matches a character in the sequence, press the spacebar. If you skip a character or press the spacebar on the wrong character, it counts as a mistake, and the cursor moves to the nearest correct character in the sequence.

   For example, in the image above, characters ㅔ, ㅐ, ㄷ, and ㅑ have already been found. The next character to input is ㅜ. If you miss ㅜ or press the spacebar on the wrong character, the cursor moves to the next character in the sequence, ㅈ.
3. The attempt ends when the cursor reaches the final character in the sequence.

## Training Settings

### Duration (Minutes)

The training ends after the current attempt finishes if the preset training duration is exceeded. The recommended training duration is around 5 minutes, and sessions exceeding 10 minutes are not advised.

### Character Type

Sets the type of characters used in the training. Using characters from the trainee's native language is most effective. The available character types are:

- **Numbers**: Digits from 0 to 9
- **Alphabets**: Uppercase letters from A to Z
- **Alphabets + Numbers**: Uppercase letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9)
- **Korean**: Korean consonants (e.g., ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ) and vowels (e.g., ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ)

**To lower the difficulty**, select simpler character types (e.g., from `Alphabets + Numbers` to `Alphabets` or `Numbers`).

**To increase the difficulty**, select more complex character types (e.g., from `Numbers` to `Alphabets + Numbers`).

### Sequence Type

Sets the type of sequence used in the training. The options are:

- **Sequential**: The sequence is displayed in order (e.g., `ABCD`, `ㄱㄴㄷㄹ`, `1234`).
- **Random**: The sequence is displayed randomly (e.g., `HOEB`, `ㅐㅎㅍㅓ`, `0584`).

Using a sequential sequence **significantly lowers** the difficulty, while a random sequence **significantly increases** it.

If using a random sequence, encourage the trainee to memorize as many characters as possible at once and locate them based on their memory.

### Sequence Length

Sets the length of the sequence used in the training. The length can be adjusted from `1` to `25`, with longer sequences significantly **increasing difficulty**.

## Adjusting Training Difficulty

Based on training results, you can determine whether the current settings are appropriate:

### Accuracy/Average Accuracy

- **Below 70%**: The difficulty is too high. If low accuracy persists (2–3 sessions), reduce the difficulty for the next session.
- **70%–80%**: The difficulty is appropriate. Continue with the current settings for the next session.
- **Above 80%**: The difficulty is too low. Increase the difficulty for the next session.

### Average Attempt Time

- **Over 40 seconds**: The difficulty is too high. If this persists (2–3 sessions), reduce the difficulty for the next session.
- **30–40 seconds**: The difficulty is appropriate. Continue with the current settings for the next session.
- **Below 30 seconds**: The difficulty is too low. Increase the difficulty for the next session.

Adjust the settings within the recommended ranges based on the above criteria to optimize training effectiveness.
