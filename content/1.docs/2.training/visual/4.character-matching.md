title: Character Matching
description: Training to locate and click on matching characters from visually similar options
---

## Overview

Character Matching training involves clicking on strings that visually match a given example. This training enhances visual planning, perception speed, shape perception, visual memory, ocular motor skills, directionality, and temporal visual processing.

Each training attempt follows this sequence and repeats until the allotted training time is exceeded:

1. At the start of an attempt, the example string is displayed at the top.

2. Using the mouse, locate and click on strings in the input field below that match the example. The input field contains 30% correct answers and 70% incorrect answers, with incorrect strings differing from the example by only one character. The number of remaining correct answers is also displayed below.

3. Once all correct strings are located, the training progresses to the next attempt.

## Training Settings

### Duration (Minutes)

The training ends after the current attempt finishes if the preset training duration is exceeded. The recommended training duration is around 5 minutes, and sessions exceeding 10 minutes are not advised.

### Character Type

Sets the type of characters used in the training. Using characters from the trainee's native language is most effective. The available character types are:

- **Numbers**: Digits from 0 to 9
- **Alphabets**: Uppercase letters from A to Z
- **Alphabets + Numbers**: Uppercase letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9)
- **Korean**: Korean consonants (e.g., ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ) and vowels (e.g., ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ)

**To lower the difficulty**, select simpler character types (e.g., from `Alphabets + Numbers` to `Alphabets` or `Numbers`).

**To increase the difficulty**, select more complex character types (e.g., from `Numbers` to `Alphabets + Numbers`).

### Answer Length

Sets the length of the strings used in the training. The length can be set between 2 and 6. Increasing the number of characters **significantly increases difficulty**.

### Number of Answers

Sets the number of correct answers displayed in the input field. This can be set between 15 and 60. Increasing the number of correct answers **slightly increases difficulty**.

## Adjusting Training Difficulty

Based on training results, you can determine whether the current settings are appropriate:

### Accuracy/Average Accuracy

- **Below 70%**: The difficulty is too high. If low accuracy persists (2–3 sessions), reduce the difficulty for the next session.
- **70%–80%**: The difficulty is appropriate. Continue with the current settings for the next session.
- **Above 80%**: The difficulty is too low. Increase the difficulty for the next session.

### Average Attempt Time

- **Over 40 seconds**: The difficulty is too high. If this persists (2–3 sessions), reduce the difficulty for the next session.
- **30–40 seconds**: The difficulty is appropriate. Continue with the current settings for the next session.
- **Below 30 seconds**: The difficulty is too low. Increase the difficulty for the next session.

Adjust the settings within the recommended ranges based on the above criteria to optimize training effectiveness.
