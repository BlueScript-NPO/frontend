title: Sequential Visual Memory
description: Training to recall and input letters displayed sequentially

## Overview

Sequential Visual Memory training involves identifying and memorizing a series of characters displayed in sequence and recalling them after a set delay. This training enhances sequential visual memory, working memory, perception speed, visual-motor accuracy, and sequential processing ability.

Each training attempt follows this sequence and repeats until the allotted training time is exceeded:

1. Characters are displayed one by one in order on the screen.

2. After all characters are displayed, a delay (which can be disabled by setting to 0 seconds) shows a random pattern on the screen.

3. Once the pattern disappears, the trainee inputs the characters they remember and checks their answers.

## Training Settings

### Duration (Minutes)

The training ends after the current attempt finishes if the preset training duration is exceeded. The recommended training duration is around 5 minutes, and sessions exceeding 10 minutes are not advised.

### Character Type

Sets the type of characters used in the training. Using characters from the trainee's native language is most effective. The available character types are:

- **Numbers**: Digits from 0 to 9
- **Alphabets**: Uppercase letters from A to Z
- **Alphabets + Numbers**: Uppercase letters (A-Z) and numbers (0-9)
- **Korean**: Korean consonants (e.g., ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄷ) and vowels (e.g., ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ)

**To lower the difficulty**, select simpler character types (e.g., from `Alphabets + Numbers` to `Alphabets` or `Numbers`).

**To increase the difficulty**, select more complex character types (e.g., from `Numbers` to `Alphabets + Numbers`).

### Character Length

Sets the length of the character sequence used in the training. The length can be set from `1` to `6`, and longer sequences significantly **increase difficulty**.

### Delay Time (Seconds)

Sets the time for which the random pattern is displayed after the characters. Delay time can be adjusted from `0` to `25` seconds. Longer delays **slightly** increase the difficulty. The recommended range is `0` to `15` seconds. If adjusting the delay time is insufficient to fine-tune the difficulty, modify the character length instead.

## Adjusting Training Difficulty

Based on training results, you can determine whether the current settings are appropriate:

### Accuracy/Average Accuracy

- **Below 70%**: The difficulty is too high. If low accuracy persists (2–3 sessions), reduce the difficulty for the next session.
- **70%–80%**: The difficulty is appropriate. Continue with the current settings for the next session.
- **Above 80%**: The difficulty is too low. Increase the difficulty for the next session.

After assessing the difficulty using the above criteria, adjust the training settings within the recommended ranges.
