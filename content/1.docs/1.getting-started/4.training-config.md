## Overview

BlueScript training allows users to customize their training settings. The difficulty level of the training has a significant impact on its success. If the difficulty is too high, the training becomes too challenging and less effective. Conversely, if the difficulty is too low, the training may become monotonous, also reducing its effectiveness. Therefore, adjusting the difficulty appropriately is key to conducting effective training sessions.

## Adjusting Difficulty

Visit the [Training](/train) page to select a training module. You can also click the **Help** button to learn how to use each training module.

Once you select a module for training, you can configure its settings as shown in the image below. All training modules have settings for **time** and **character type**, which do not affect difficulty. In addition to these, each module includes unique settings. **Settings at the top have a greater impact on difficulty than those below.**

For example, in the Rapid Visual Perception module, adjusting **character length** by one step using the side arrows has a greater impact on difficulty than changing the **display time** by one step. Refer to each module's documentation for details on its specific settings.

## Training Results

Training results are crucial indicators for adjusting the difficulty of subsequent sessions. Use the results to adjust difficulty as follows:
