## For General Users

BlueScript is provided as a web application, allowing you to use it easily from anywhere with just a **browser**, without any installation process. Visit the official web application and start utilizing all the features of BlueScript right away.

## Self-Hosting

In addition to the official web application, you can host **BlueScript** on your own server. This option is suitable for those with server management skills or those who prefer a customized environment.

### Hosting with Docker

BlueScript can be easily hosted using the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/suhjae/bluescript). Follow the steps below to install Docker and run the BlueScript server.

#### **1. Install Docker**

If Docker is not already installed, download and install Docker for your platform from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).

#### **2. Pull the BlueScript Docker Image**

Once Docker is installed, download the official BlueScript image by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker pull suhjae/bluescript
```

#### **3. Run BlueScript**

After downloading the Docker image, start the container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:3000 --name bluescript suhjae/bluescript
```

Here:

- `-d` runs the container in the background.
- `-p 80:3000` maps port 80 on your local machine to port 3000 inside the container.

#### **4. Access BlueScript**

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost` to access BlueScript.

#### **5. Configure Settings**

For additional configuration, you can modify the `docker-compose.yml` file or use Docker environment variables to customize BlueScript. For example, you can set up a web proxy like [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) within the `docker-compose.yml` file to connect your domain and create a more advanced setup.
